"""
This package contains module for helper functions for various kinds of analysis of transit equity data.

The modules and the contained functions in this package are currently very specific to their analysis 
    and are not intended to be used as a general-purpose library.
In its current state, this module contains helper functions 
    that are only known to the specific authors of the specific functions.
These are intended to reduce the bloat in the main analysis notebooks present in the private repository.
    Please contact the authors of the respective functions for more information.

TODO: There may be a future plan to refactor these functions 
    to make them part of the general-purpose transit_equity library.

Modules:
    - 'low_income': Helper Functions for Analysis of low-income populations and transit access
