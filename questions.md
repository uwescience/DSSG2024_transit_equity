Though ORCA fare cards have existed in some form since 2009, there have been limited opportunities to explore the data and synthesize meaning from the millions of trips recorded in the ORCA database. This is not from lack of interest by the participating agencies; rather, due to the size and complexity of the dataset, just managing the data is a full time job for multiple employees. Performing data analysis is a much desired and necessary next step to facilitate data-driven improvements to our region's transit systems. Our transit equity team, comprised of graduate students from the fields of urban planning, data and computer science, and community ecology, is using ORCA data to reveal insights into usage patterns of ORCA riders from disadvantaged communities that can identify areas for improvement and guide transportation in the Puget Sound region towards a more equitable future. 


We are interested broadly in identifying patterns in transit use between ORCA card user demographics that will enable us assess quality of service across all types of ORCA card users. More specifically, our analyses seek to answer several questions:  

1) Are stops that are central in transit ridership networks shared across all card demographics? How do the networks vary in structure between card demographics? Is the structure of these networks reflected by the geographic layout of the transportation network?

2) How do transit users behave on the temporal scale? What are the types of users on the temporal scale? Do certain type of users need better service quality?

3) Do hotspots of transfer have adequate shelters? Do low-income riders suffer more from not having adequate shelters? 

4) Are low-income riders receiving an adequate level of service across all regions in Puget Sound? Where is the service inadequate for low-income riders?

5) How do ORCA users look like in terms of behavior? Do low-income riders behave differently?
