Who are the important stakeholders and what has your team done to take them into consideration?
Because transit is a multifaceted social good, we considered stakeholders from multiple sectors. Our transit organization and policy stakeholders include Sound Transit, King County Metro, the Federal Transit Administration, the ORCA joint board, and other local transit agencies. Our transit advocacy stakeholder groups include the Transit Riders Union, Disability Rights Washington, El Centro de la Raza, the Amalgamated Transit Union, King County Social Services, and Commute Seattle. Additionally, businesses are stakeholders from the perspective of organizations who purchase bulk ORCA cards for employees through the business passport program and as locations serviced by transit. Finally, stakeholders internal to our internship program include the University of Washington eScience Institute, Data Science for Social Good Fellows and project leads present and future, and the Washington State Transportation Center (TRAC).
