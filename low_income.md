**Problem Context**

The high-level idea is to compare low-income ridership with low-income populations, on an equity basis. The level of granularity we intend to use to make these comparisons is the census block group. 

One left side, we could measure ridership of a census block group, either by boardings, unique users, or trips. We can measure this using the LIFT card (low-income card) details that we have in the ORCA database. 

- Boardings can be used to measure the actual usage (in a way, realizations of the potential) of the services offered by transit services. 

- Unique users are those who have used their LIFT cards at least once 

- When we say trips, we mean estimating the number of routes (multiplied by their frequency) that go through a census block group. Thus, trips can be used to measure the expected potential of the services offered by transit services. 

One the right side, we could measure low-income population in a census block group. Not just that, we could also measure other equity-based factors such as transit (or other) activity by low-income populations in a census block group, or jobs available for low-income populations in the census-block group.
