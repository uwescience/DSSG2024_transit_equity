**Data**

What data sets are you using?
What did you do to prepare the data?

**Tools (aka “component specification”)**

What software packages, modules, etc. did you use? 
What are the dependencies between these and how did you render them interoperable?

**Problem Context**

The high-level idea is to compare ridership with populations, on an equity basis. 

One left side, we could measure ridership of a census block group, either by boardings, or trips. When we say trips, we mean estimating the number of routes (multiplied by their frequency) that go through a census block group. 

Thus, trips can be used to measure the expected potential of the services offered by transit services. 

Boardings can be used to measure the actual usage (in a way, realizations of the potential) of the services offered by transit services. 

One the right side, we could measure low-income population in a census block group. Not just that, we could also measure other equity-based factors such as transit (or other) activity by low-income populations in a census block group, or jobs available for low-income populations in the census-block group.
